## Your ultimate introduction to two-photon microscopy
This survival guide is for those with little or no experience in microscopy. It shows you how to approach the beast — a two-photon microscope — for the first time without destroying it. The guide will teach you everything you need to know before embarking on your own research project.

Unlike humans (for example, your supervisor), who might get sick, work from home, or simply not answer your calls, this ultimate guide is always there for you.

The program consists of five days of hands-on training, during which you will perform experiments and interpret the results.
