## What can go wrong with the microscope and how to solve it?

### 1. Zigzags on images: Laser intensity fluctuations
![laser intensity fluctuations]({{ '/assets/images/issue_laser.jpg' | relative_url }})

If you see this, or similar, wavy-pattern on your images, check the laser power in the microscope's software (if available).
If it is fluctuating, you have a laser problem.
In this particular case, there was a problem in an old pumping laser for the two-photon pulsed laser.
